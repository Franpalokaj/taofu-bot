## 0. IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: TAOFU vs TPN

**CRITICAL: These are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS:**

### TAOFU (The Platform)
- **What**: A launchpad and tokenization platform for ALL Bittensor subnets
- **Purpose**: Helps subnet owners raise funds by tokenizing emissions (SNS)
- **Users**: Subnet owners wanting to raise capital, investors wanting to buy SNS
- **Technology needed**: Just a web browser and TAO tokens to participate
- **No coding required**: It's a web platform like any other launchpad

### TPN (A Subnet Using Taofu)
- **What**: Subnet 65 - a decentralized VPN infrastructure
- **Purpose**: Provides VPN services through distributed miners
- **Users**: VPN users, miners providing bandwidth, developers building VPN apps
- **Technology needed**: Linux servers, Python, Docker, technical knowledge for mining
- **Coding required**: Yes, for mining/validating

### Key Clarification
- **Same team**: Yes, both are developed by Taofu Labs
- **Same thing**: NO! Taofu is the platform, TPN is just ONE subnet that might use Taofu
- **Relationship**: TPN is a showcase/example of a subnet that could potentially use Taofu's services

### When Someone Asks About:
- "Using Taofu" → Web platform, buying SNS tokens, no technical setup
- "Mining on Taofu" → WRONG! You don't mine on Taofu, you mine on subnets like TPN
- "TPN requirements" → Technical Linux/Python setup for mining
- "Investing through Taofu" → Buying SNS tokens with TAO through the web platform

## 1. WHAT IS TAOFU

Taofu is a groundbreaking platform that empowers Bittensor subnet teams to raise capital and decentralize control by issuing Subnet Seeds (SNS). Taofu solves a critical challenge in the Bittensor ecosystem: subnet owners previously had to sell their alpha token emissions to secure runway, which drained TAO liquidity from their subnet pools and undermined long-term growth.

Taofu provides:
- Subnet Launchpad services for tokenization
- Governance infrastructure for subnet emissions
- A sustainable funding model that preserves subnet liquidity

The platform enables subnet owners to secure funding without depleting their initial alpha token reserves, while contributors gain governance rights and participate in the subnet's growth.

**What Taofu is NOT**:
- Not a subnet itself (it's a platform for ALL subnets)
- Not a mining operation (it's a web-based launchpad)
- Not TPN (TPN is a separate VPN subnet project)
- Not requiring technical setup (just web browser + TAO)

**Relationship with TPN**: TPN (TAO Private Network) is Subnet 65, a decentralized VPN infrastructure project developed by the same team. It serves as both a standalone subnet and a potential future user of Taofu's tokenization services.

## 2. KEY CONCEPTS

### Subnet Seeds (SNS)
- Tradable tokens representing tokenized subnet emissions
- Grant holders governance rights over subnet decisions
- Allow subnet owners to raise capital without selling alpha tokens
- Maintain subnet liquidity while providing funding

### dTAO System
- Bittensor's new economic model with subnet-specific liquidity pools
- Each subnet has its own alpha tokens
- 1 TAO emitted per block network-wide
- 2 alpha tokens generated per subnet per block

### Alpha Token Streams
- **alpha_in**: 0-1 alpha per block, flows into subnet's liquidity pool
- **alpha_out**: 1 alpha per block, distributed as rewards:
  - 18% to subnet owners
  - 41% to miners
  - 41% to validators

### The Growth vs. Liquidity Dilemma
- Subnet owners need TAO for runway
- Selling alpha tokens drains subnet liquidity pools
- Less liquidity means fewer future emissions
- Taofu solves this by allowing tokenization instead of selling

## 2.5. BITTENSOR BASICS

### What is Bittensor?
- Open-source platform for decentralized machine intelligence
- Network of specialized subnets producing digital commodities
- Uses TAO token as native currency
- Validators evaluate miners' work quality

### Network Participants
- **Miners**: Produce digital commodities (AI, compute, storage, etc.)
- **Validators**: Evaluate miner quality and set weights
- **Subnet Creators**: Design incentive mechanisms
- **Stakers**: Support validators by staking TAO

### Subnet Structure
- Each subnet = independent community with specific task
- Typically 256 neurons (64 validator slots, rest for miners)
- Subnets compete for TAO emissions
- Each subnet has unique netuid (network ID)

## 3. HOW TAOFU WORKS

### Step 1: Tokenization
- Subnets tokenize their owner key to create Subnet Seeds (SNS)
- Subnet owners retain full admin control over their subnet
- SNS represent future alpha_out emissions

### Step 2: Launch
- SNS tokens are launched on Taofu's curated launchpad
- Contributors purchase SNS with TAO
- All purchases are made in TAO only

### Step 3: Governance
- SNS holders participate in subnet governance decisions
- Creates a decentralized and engaged community
- Aligns interests of subnet owners, validators, and token holders

## 4. TOKENOMICS & FEES

### TAOFU Token
- Native governance and utility token of the Taofu ecosystem
- Protocol fees from SNS sales accrue to Taofu treasury
- TAOFU holders receive:
  - Priority access to launchpad sales
  - Early investment opportunities
  - Increased allocation limits
  - Voting rights on protocol parameters

### Fee Structure
- Protocol fee collected on every SNS token sale
- Fees denominated in subnet's tokenized emissions
- Future staking mechanisms may allow revenue sharing

## 5. PARTICIPATION & SALES PROCESS

### Whitelisting
- Users register on Taofu platform
- Sign terms and conditions
- Submit wallet address for verification
- Approved addresses recorded on-chain
- Individual purchase caps enforced

### Purchase Process
- TAO-only purchases (no other currencies accepted)
- Direct deposit into sale contract
- Individual caps per wallet
- No active Sybil attack prevention

### Vesting Schedules
- Uniform vesting rules for all participants
- Linear vesting schedule for SNS tokens
- Initial lock-up periods followed by gradual release
- Subnet owners, curators, and Taofu follow same schedule

## 6. TECHNICAL INTEGRATION

### Platform Features
- Curated platform with rigorous subnet vetting
- Evaluation of tokenomics, technical roadmaps, team credibility
- Mandatory vesting schedules for founders
- Liquidity provisions for market stability

### Bittensor Integration
- Deep integration with Bittensor infrastructure

## 8. FUTURE DEFI STRATEGIES

### Potential SNS Use Cases
- **Collateralization**: Use SNS as collateral for loans
- **Yield Farming**: Stake SNS in liquidity pools
- **Derivatives**: Futures or options tied to subnet emissions
- **Index Funds**: Bundle multiple SNS tokens for diversified exposure

## 9. TPN SUBNET (SUBNET 65) - EXAMPLE PROJECT

**IMPORTANT**: TPN is NOT Taofu. It's a separate subnet project by the same team that showcases what can be built in the Bittensor ecosystem.

### Overview
TPN (TAO Private Network) is a subnet-powered decentralized VPN infrastructure operating as Subnet 65 on mainnet (Subnet 279 on testnet). It's designed to be "the AWS of decentralized VPNs" - a protocol that developers can build upon to create their own VPN applications.

**Relationship to Taofu**: TPN is developed by Taofu Labs but is a SEPARATE project. It could potentially use Taofu's platform to tokenize its emissions in the future, but they are distinct products.

### Current Status
- **Phase**: Beta mode (VPN scaffolding present, consumer endpoints coming soon)
- **Mac App**: Available in beta for free to showcase decentralized VPN capabilities
